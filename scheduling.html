				<p class="editable">1 hour appointment - $100</p>
				<p class="editable">Each appointment includes 50 minutes of focused work on the massage table and 5-10 minutes at both the beginning and at the end of your time to discuss goals and your personalized treatment plan.</p>
				<p class="editable">Please plan for a maximum of 75 minutes for your appointment time.</p>
				<p class="editable"><b>Important Notes</b></p>
                <p class="editable">You will stay fully clothed for the whole appointment so please come dressed in loose comfortable clothing. Preferably no jeans.</p>
				<p class="editable">Since this is very different than a typical Swedish massage, please reach our if you have any questions. I’d love to talk with you about what you’re hoping to get out of your appointment!</p>
