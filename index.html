				<p class="editable">Figuring out what your needs are can be overwhelming and it’s really tough to know where to start!</p>
				<p class="editable">I know how challenging it is to figure out how to navigate life without support and that it can feel impossible to find a moment of calm and stillness in the whirlwind of things that are constantly trying to get your attention.</p>
				<p class="editable">Here’s the thing…</p>
				<p class="editable">While you have to be really intentional about it, it IS possible to make growth and healing a priority in the midst of the chaos. When you set aside the time to meet your own needs, you begin to see new ways to give yourself the love, compassion, and healing that you deserve simply because you exist.</p>
				<p class="editable">You matter.</p>
				<p class="editable">Your needs matter.</p>
				<p class="editable">I can help you as you navigate your own healing journey.</p>
