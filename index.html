				<p class="editable">Whether you are just starting out on your healing journey or are well into it, finding consistent support can be a huge challenge!</p>
				<p class="editable">That’s where I can help.</p>
				<p class="editable">Using gentle bodywork techniques, energy healing, and breath work, I encourage your body to recognize relaxation patterns so that it can self correct and unwind from old stuck patterns created by habits, tension, and/or responses to pain.</p>
				<p class="editable">Throughout each session, I’ll teach you how to listen to the subtle cues your body uses to communicate, identify habitual patterns that might be causing your tension or pain, and build a deeper connection with the amazing and whole person that you already are.</p>
