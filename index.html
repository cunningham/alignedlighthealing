				<h2 class="editable">I get it</h2>
				<p class="editable">Figuring out what your needs are can be overwhelming and it’s really tough to know where to start!</p>
				<p class="editable">I know how challenging it is to figure out how to navigate life without support and that it can feel impossible to find a moment of calm and stillness in the whirlwind of things that are constantly trying to get your attention.</p>
				<p class="editable">Here’s the thing…</p>
				<p class="editable">While you have to be really intentional about it, it IS possible to make growth and healing a priority in the midst of the chaos. When you set aside the time to meet your own needs, you begin to see new ways to give yourself the love, compassion, and healing that you deserve simply because you exist.</p>
				<p class="editable">You matter.</p>
				<p class="editable">Your needs matter.</p>
				<p class="editable">I can help you as you navigate your own healing journey.</p>

				<p class="editable">Whether you are just starting out on your healing journey or are well into it, finding consistent support can be a huge challenge!</p>
				<p class="editable">That’s where I come in.</p>
				<p class="editable">Bodywork</p>
				<p class="editable">  • Through gentle bodywork techniques, I encourage your body to recognize relaxation patterns so that it can self correct and unwind from old patterns created by habits, tension, and/or responses to pain.</p>
				<p class="editable">Interoceptive awareness</p>
				<p class="editable">  • Using elements of breath work, energy balancing, and guided visualization, I teach you how to listen to your body, figure out what needs attention, and help you build a deeper connection with the amazing and whole person that you already are.</p>
				<p class="editable">Wellness coaching</p>
				<p class="editable">  • To make sure that you are supported in between appointments, I provide personalized guidance for practical self care and techniques that you can use at home at any time.</p>
